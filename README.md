## 🔭 Current Projects
Currently building a smart Music Recommendation Feature that fills my "music void."
It uses NLP and ML to take in my mood or vibe prompts, combines them with my listening history, and returns a personalized playlist of tracks that just get me.
A fun project blending my love for data and music — and a small step toward emotionally intelligent algorithms.
